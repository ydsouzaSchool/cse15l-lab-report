## Task 1
Using the cd command: 
![Image](/cdCommands.png)
1. `cd` takes you to the home directory
2. `cd *a directory*` as the argument will take you inside the directory, provided the file path exists
3. `cd *a file*` as the argument will give you an error since the purpose of cd is to navigate through directories/ folders, not files.
4. `cd *..*` as the argument takes you one level higher in the directory tree
   On researching more about the `cd` command, I learnt that it stands for change directory, so the above behaviour is rationalized.
